"""
Type representing a set of agents in matching markets. This class is 
used in TwoSidedMatchingMarket and OneSidedMatchingMarket.

* In two sided matching problems this type represents a set of
  agents on each side.

* In object allocation problems this type represents a set of agents.

# Fields

- `size::Int` : The number of agents.

- `prefs::Vector{Vector{Int}}` : Vector of preferences of agents.
  Each inside vector contains a strict preference order over 
  the agents or the objects of another side, and the outside option (0). 

  `prefs[i][j]` represents the `j`-th preferable agent/object in 
  another side of the market for the `i`-th agent. 

  This vector does not necessarily need to include all agents or 
  objects in another side. Those not listed in the preference vector 
  are treated as unacceptable (assuming the outside option locates
  right after the last agents/objects).

- `caps::Vector{Int}` : Vector of length `size` containing the
  maximum numbers(capacities) each player can match.
